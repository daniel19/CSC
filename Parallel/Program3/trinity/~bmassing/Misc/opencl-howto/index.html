<H1>Using OpenCL on the CS Linux Machines</H1>

<P>
All of our classroom machines and a few of our lab machines
have graphics cards that support GPGPU (General Purpose computing
using Graphics Processing Units).
On these machines we have installed proprietary drivers
(from AMD or NVIDIA), which support OpenCL,
and AMD's Accelerated Parallel Processing toolkit, which
provides programming support. 
(On a few of the lab machines we have also installed NVIDIA's CUDA
toolkit, which also provides programming support.  Ask me for details
if interested.)
This note describes how to develop OpenCL programs
in C or C++ using AMD's toolkit.
Notice that you may have other options for GPGPU programming
(e.g., the AMD toolkit includes a Java library called Aparapi 
meant to support this kind of programming), in which case the
sections on compiling and running OpenCL programs are not
relevant, but the other sections are.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00001000000000000000">
Preliminaries</A>
</H2>

<P>
The first thing to do is to confirm
that the machine you want to use has the right combination
of hardware and software. 
For hardware, a quick crude way to do this is to issue the command
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><TT>lspci | grep VGA</TT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
which should produce a one-line description of the machine's
graphics card.  If it claims to be from NVIDIA or AMD, then
the odds are good that its driver supports OpenCL.
For software, check for the presence of directory <TT>/opt/AMDAPP</TT>,
which is the AMD toolkit.
If the graphics card is from AMD, you should also check whether
you have access to the GPU by running the command <TT>clinfo</TT>;
if its output shows information about 
a device of type <TT>CL_DEVICE_TYPE_GPU</TT>,
then all is well.
(This should be the case if you're logged in from the console
in graphical mode.)
If the command runs, but its output shows information about only
one ``device'', of type <TT>CL_DEVICE_TYPE_CPU</TT>,
then the machine has the right setup,
but you do not have access to the GPU.
(This will likely be the case if you are logged in remotely.
The section ``Access to the GPU'' describes what you can do in that case.)

<P>
Next you will need to add the installation path for the AMD toolkit
to your search path and set related environment variables.
You can do that with the command
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><TT>module load amdapp</TT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
You could put this in your <TT>.bashrc</TT>
file, as discussed in 
<A NAME="tex2html2"
  HREF="../../Misc/gcc-howto/index.html">my notes on the GNU compilers</A>
if you don't want to type it in every time you want to use OpenCL.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00002000000000000000">
Compiling OpenCL programs</A>
</H2>

<P>
You should be able to compile with either a C compiler (e.g., <TT>gcc</TT>)
or a C++ compiler (e.g., <TT>g++</TT>).
You will need a number of flags:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
-DAMD_OS_LINUX -I/opt/AMDAPP/include -lOpenCL -L/opt/AMDAPP/lib/x86_64
	
</BLOCKQUOTE>Simple usage:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
gcc -DAMD_OS_LINUX -I/opt/AMDAPP/include -lOpenCL -L/opt/AMDAPP/lib/x86_64 example.c -o example
	
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Your program will probably need a <TT>#include</TT> line for either
<TT>CL/cl.h</TT> (plain C) or 
<TT>CL/cl.hpp</TT> (C++).

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00003000000000000000">
Running OpenCL programs</A>
</H2>

<P>
To execute the compiled program, just type the name of the executable.  
If you've set things up correctly, and you have access to the GPU
(as described earlier), all should be well (assuming no bugs in the
program itself!).

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00004000000000000000">
Access to the GPU</A>
</H2>

<P>
(Notice that the following applies only to machines with AMD
graphics cards.  On machines with NVIDIA graphics cards, 
everything should just work, although the NVIDIA driver apparently
does not support running OpenCL kernels on the CPU, while the
AMD driver does.)

<P>
AMD's implementation for its own hardware
apparently accesses the GPU by way of the
X server (the graphical subsystem in most UNIX/Linux systems).
This works fine for regular users logged in via a graphical login
(even in terminal windows)
and for the root user.  For non-root users logged in remotely,
e.g., via an SSH connection, it doesn't work so well.
We have installed a workaround that allows regular users 
logged in remotely to access the GPU.
To use it you need to do two things:

<P>
First, you need to be a member of the ``GPU users'' group;
one of the sysadmins can add you to this group, so
ask your instructor or research supervisor, or get in touch with
one of the admins directly.

<P>
Next, when you log in remotely, you need to run the following
command:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><TT>source /tmp/enable-amd-compute</TT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>(Notice that the word in the middle of the filename is
<TT>amd</TT> (as in AMD) and not <TT>and</TT>.)
You can check that all is well by executing the <TT>clinfo</TT>
command; 
it should report information for 
a device of type <TT>CL_DEVICE_TYPE_GPU</TT>.
If it doesn't, something has gone wrong, 
and we (the admins) would like to hear about it.
