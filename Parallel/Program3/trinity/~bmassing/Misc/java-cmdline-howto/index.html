<H1>Java From the Command Line</H1>

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00001000000000000000">
Overview</A>
</H2>

<P>
In several of our courses we encourage students to develop programs
with an IDE (Eclipse or Visual Studio)
because IDEs have many built-in features that make it easier
to work with large programs.
Eclipse in particular provides good support for Java,
so it is reasonable enough to use it to develop Java programs.
But it is perfectly possible to write, compile, and run
Java programs with any text editor and the command-line tools that
come with typical Java implementations, and sometimes it can make
sense to do so, 
or to use a combination of an IDE and command-line tools.
This document describes how to do this under Linux.

<P>
Situations in which you might find this useful include writing
short throwaway programs, maklng very small changes to programs of
any size, and running programs with command-line arguments or
environment variables that should vary from execution to execution.
You might even adopt a hybrid development strategy, developing the
programs with an IDE and then running them from the command line
(by opening a separate terminal window and navigating to the 
appropriate part of the IDE's workspace directory).

<P>

Writing Java programs</A>
</H2>

<P>
You can write Java programs with any text editor
(program that lets you edit standard ASCII text files).  
Among UNIX enthusiasts, whose editor is
better is a subject of perennial debate.  
Two popular and powerful (if not exactly novice-friendly) groups
of editors are 

<UL>
<LI><code>vi</code> and its clones/successors.  On Linux systems, the 
	command <code>vi</code> actually invokes <code>vim</code> (``VI iMproved''),
	one such successor.  There is also a graphically-oriented
	variant <code>gvim</code>, worth trying if you like GUIs.
	The command <code>vimtutor</code> brings up a tutorial;
	half an hour with this tutorial will likely make using
	<code>vi</code> a more pleasant experience.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><code>emacs</code>, which when started in graphical mode presents
	a graphical interface and a text-only interface otherwise
	(or when started with <code>-nw</code>).
	Once in <code>emacs</code>, pressing <code>control-h</code> and then
	<code>t</code> brings up a tutorial, which again is worth spending
	half an hour with.
</LI>
</UL>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00003000000000000000">
Compiling Java programs</A>
</H2>

<P>
A Java compiler is installed on the department Linux machines as
<code>/usr/java/latest/bin/javac</code>.
(If everything is set up correctly in your account,
this should be the same as just <code>javac</code>.  
Confirm this with <code>which javac</code>.)
So you could compile, for example, program
<code>Hello.java</code> by typing the following command.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<code>javac Hello.java</code>

</BLOCKQUOTE>
This assumes that all the classes needed by <code>Hello.java</code> 
are either part of the standard Java libraries or in the current
directory.
If some of the classes referenced in <code>Hello.java</code> are in
a JAR file, say <code>MyLib.jar</code>, you would need to type
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<code>javac -classpath .:MyLib.jar Hello.java</code>

</BLOCKQUOTE>
By default the <code>.class</code> files are created in the current
directory, but you can use the <code>-d</code> option to specify a different
location, e.g.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<code>javac -d obj -classpath Hello.java</code>
</BLOCKQUOTE>to put them in <code>obj</code>.

<P>
If you want to compile many files, especially if they are contained in
multiple directories, as is typically the case when using packages,
you could type something such as the following, which finds all <code>.java</code>
files in <code>pkg</code> and compiles them, placing the results in <code>obj</code>.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<code>javac -d obj `find pkg -name "*.java"`</code>
</BLOCKQUOTE>(Notice that <code>`</code> is the backquote character near the top left corner
of most keyboards and not the single-quote character.)

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00004000000000000000">
Running Java programs</A>
</H2>

<P>
Unlike programs written in C++ and many other languages, Java programs
do not compile to code that can be executed directly.  
Instead they compile to ``byte code'' (<code>.class</code> files) meant to
be executed by a Java virtual machine.  A JVM is installed on
the department Linux machines as
<code>/usr/java/latest/bin/java</code>
(which again should be the same as just <code>java</code> if everything
is set up right). 
So if you want to run the <code>main</code> method in class
<code>Hello</code>, you would type the following command.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<code>java Hello</code>
</BLOCKQUOTE>To pass command-line arguments to <code>main</code> in <code>Hello</code>,
type them at the end of the above command separated by spaces.  
Notice that arguments that
contain spaces or other characters that mean something to your
shell (e.g., the wildcard character ``*'') need to be enclosed in
double or single codeDisplay.
Again, the above command assumes
that all the classes needed by <code>Hello.java</code> 
are either part of the standard Java libraries or in the current
directory.
If some of the classes referenced in <code>Hello.java</code> are in
a JAR file, say <code>MyLib.jar</code>, you would need to type
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<code>java -classpath .:MyLib.jar Hello</code>
</BLOCKQUOTE>You can abbreviate <code>-classpath</code> as <code>-cp</code>.
If the classes are not in the current directory, 
you would need to type something such as the following (if the classes are
in directory <code>obj</code>)
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<code>java -classpath obj Hello</code>
</BLOCKQUOTE>If the class whose <code>main</code> method you want to run is part of
a package,
you would need to type something such as the following,
which runs <code>Hello</code> in package <code>pkg</code>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<code>java -classpath obj pkg.Hello</code>
</BLOCKQUOTE>Notice that this assumes that <code>Hello.class</code> is in <code>obj/pkg</code>,
as described briefly in the next section.

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00005000000000000000">
Java packages versus directories/folders</A>
</H2>

<P>
Java normally expects source code for package <code>x.y.z</code> to be
stored in a directory (folder) <code>x/y/z</code>. 
Eclipse automatically creates an appropriate directory structure
when you create a package; if you're working from the command
line, you should do it yourself (e.g., with <code>mkdir</code>).
