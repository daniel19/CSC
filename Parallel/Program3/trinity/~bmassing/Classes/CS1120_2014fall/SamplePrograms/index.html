CSCI 1120 (Low-Level Computing): <br>
	Sample Programs

</h1>

<p>
<i>Disclaimer:</i> Code linked from this page is intended as a
cleaned-up and commented version of examples from class.
Many programs could be further improved with
regard to functionality or design, but then they would
no longer be as close to what we did in class.
</p>

<h2> Programs </h2>

<ul>

<li> "Hello, world" program (8/27):
	<a href="Programs/hello.c">hello.c</a>.

<li> Very simple example of I/O (similar to what we did in class 9/10):
	<a href="Programs/simple-io.c">simple-io.c</a>.

<li> Examples of recursion for repetition (9/24):
	<a href="Programs/recursive-sum.c">recursive-sum.c</a>.
	<a href="Programs/reverse-list.c">reverse-list.c</a>.

<li> Example of loop (10/8):
	<a href="Programs/loop-sum.c">loop-sum.c</a>.

<li> Program (not complete) 
	to generate random sequence of integers and sort them (10/15):
	<a href="Programs/sort-example.c">sort-example.c</a>.

<li> Simple example of using pointer parameters to fake
	pass-by-reference (10/22):
	<a href="Programs/pass-by-reference.c">pass-by-reference.c</a> .

<li> Simple string example (10/22):
	<a href="Programs/string-example.c">string-example.c</a> .

<li> Program to echo command-line arguments (10/29):
	<a href="Programs/echo-arguments.c">echo-arguments.c</a>.

<li> Program to copy characters from one file to another (not in class
	but close):
	<a href="Programs/copy-file.c">copy-file.c</a>.

<li> Program to sum integers read from file (10/29):
	<a href="Programs/sum-from-file.c">sum-from-file.c</a>.

<li> "Floating point is strange" examples (11/05):
	<a href="Programs/strange-float-1.c">strange-float-1.c</a>,
	<a href="Programs/strange-float-2.c">strange-float-2.c</a>.


</ul>

<h2> Other files </h2>

<ul>
<li> Script to mail files for homework submission
	<a href="Scripts/mail-files">mail-files</a>.

	To use this script, put a copy in your directory
	and use <tt>chmod u+x</tt> to make it executable.
	You can then use it to mail me one or more files
	containing source code, for example:

	<pre>
	mail-files pgm1.c pgm2.c ....
	</pre>

	It prompts for homework number and text to include as the
	body of the message, and sends a Cc of the message
	to your username at <tt>trinity.edu</tt>.

<li> Sample makefile <a href="Makefile">Makefile</a>
	for compiling C programs.

	<i>Note:</i>
	To obtain a makefile, use your browser's download function;
	cutting and pasting will likely turn the tabs in the makefile
	into spaces and cause it to not work.
	Put the makefile in the directory in which you want to
	compile.
	All the makefiles linked from this page begin with
	brief documentation on their use (the "usage examples").

</ul>
