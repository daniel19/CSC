Course description</A>
</H2>

<P>
Until recently our traditional first course for computer science
majors, CSCI&nbsp;1320 (Principles of Algorithm Design&nbsp;I in previous years,
then Principles of Programming&nbsp;I, now Principles of Computer Science&nbsp;I),
was designed to not only teach basic programming and problem solving
but also to expose students to certain concepts of computing 
closely related to the machine itself.
Recent changes to the curriculum have de-emphasized this material
in favor of more abstract topics.
CSCI&nbsp;1120 is intended to give students 
the exposure to low-level concepts previously provided by CSCI&nbsp;1320,
including a review of the Linux/UNIX command line, the basics of
computer arithmetic, and an introduction to the C programming
language.

If I'm not in my office during office hours, 
I should be somewhere in CSI,
perhaps in one of the labs helping another student, 
and there will often be a note on my door saying where to find me.

<P>
In addition to scheduled office hours, you're welcome to
drop by and see if I'm in my office and free to talk, or you
can make an appointment by calling me or sending me e-mail.

<P>
E-mail is almost always a good way to reach me;
I normally check it fairly often and reply promptly.

Grading</A>
</H3>

<P>
Grades in this course will be determined by the results of 
several homework assignments and class participation, weighted as follows.

<P>
<DIV ALIGN="CENTER">
<TABLE CELLPADDING=3 BORDER="1">
<TR><TH ALIGN="LEFT"><B>Component</B></TH>
<TH ALIGN="RIGHT"><B>Maximum points</B></TH>

<TD ALIGN="RIGHT">about 100</TD>
</TR>
<TR><TD ALIGN="LEFT">Class participation</TD>
<TD ALIGN="RIGHT">20</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
</DIV>

<P>
Numeric grades will be calculated as a simple percentage, by dividing
total points earned on the above components by total points possible.
These numeric grades will then be converted to letter grades based
on a curve, but in no case will the resulting letter grades be worse
than students would receive based on the following scheme.

Homework assignments</A>
</H3>

<P>
Homework (in the form of programming assignments)
is a crucial part of this course;
much of what you learn will likely be learned in the course
of completing the programming assignments.
Detailed requirements will be provided as part of each assignment;
due dates will be announced via the course Web page.
You are strongly encouraged to use the department's network of Linux 
machines,
but unless otherwise specified for individual assignments, you may 
use any other system that provides a suitable environment.

<P>

Attendance</A>

<P>
Regular class attendance is strongly encouraged;
class participation grades will be based largely on attendance.

<P>

<H3><A NAME="SECTION00004400000000000000">
E-mail</A>
</H3>

<P>
Course-related announcements will sometimes be made 
by sending e-mail to the Trinity e-mail addresses of
all registered students.
Students are strongly encouraged to read mail sent to
their Trinity addresses frequently.

<P>

<H3><A NAME="SECTION00004500000000000000">
Late and missed work</A>
</H3>

<P>
Unless otherwise stated for a particular assignment,
homework will be accepted up to one class period late,
<I>but no more</I>,
at a penalty of 10 percent off per working day.  
This penalty may be waived or additional time allowed
<I>at the instructor's discretion</I>
in cases of illness or conflict with a university-sponsored activity
or religious holiday.

<P>
If you have unusual circumstances (as we all sometimes do), 
please discuss these with me as far in advance as possible.

<H3><A NAME="SECTION00004600000000000000">
Academic integrity at Trinity</A>
</H3>

<P>
All students are covered by a policy that prohibits dishonesty in
academic work.  Under the Honor Code, a faculty member will (or a student
may) report an alleged violation to the Academic Honor Council.  It is the
task of the Council to investigate, adjudicate, and assign a punishment
within certain guidelines if a violation has been verified.  Students who
are under the Honor Code are required to pledge all written work that is
submitted for a grade:  ``On my honor, I have neither given nor received any
unauthorized assistance on this work'' and their signature.  
The pledge may be abbreviated ``pledged'' with a signature.
For electronically submitted work, you should include the text -- either
the full version or just ``pledged'' -- somewhere in what you submit.

<P>

<H3><A NAME="SECTION00004700000000000000">
Collaboration and academic integrity in this course</A>
</H3>

<P>
Unless otherwise specified, all work submitted for a grade
(homework assignments)
must represent the student's own individual effort.
Unless otherwise stated, all submitted work will be considered pledged work.

<P>
Discussion of homework assignments among students is allowed,
but not to the point where detailed answers 
are being written collectively.
If you are working with another student in a lab,
seeing another student's answers may be unavoidable,
but please do <I>not</I> share answers electronically.
If you are uncertain about whether a particular level of
collaboration is acceptable, please ask for clarification.
Graded papers and sample solutions from previous semesters
(homeworks) are off limits.  
Answers that are identical beyond coincidence (either to another
student's work or to a sample solution from a previous semester) will be
considered to be in violation of the Honor Code,
and <I>will result in appropriate action</I>.
You are responsible for the
security of your work, both electronic and hard copy.

<P>
Please also note when you turn in an assignment whether you sought
help with it from other students or faculty
(e.g., ``J.&nbsp;Random and I worked on this assignment together''
or ``I got help with this assignment from one of the ACM tutors'').
