Syllabus</H1>

Course description</A>
</H2>

<P>
This course is the first course for computer science majors, following
the guidelines established by the Association for Computing Machinery
(described in <A NAME="tex2html1"
  HREF="http://www.acm.org/education/CS2013-final-report.pdf">Computer Science Curriculum 2013</A>).
It also partially satisfies common-curriculum requirement
<I>Understanding Natural Science and Technology</I>.
The course is mostly an introduction to problem-solving by programming,
but also includes material traditionally covered in a first course on
programming (basics of computer arithmetic, data structures,
and sorting and searching).

If I'm not in my office during office hours, 
I should be somewhere in the building, 
perhaps in one of the labs helping another student, 
and there will often be a note on my door saying where to find me.

<P>
In addition to scheduled office hours, you're welcome to
drop by and see if I'm in my office and free to talk, or you
can make an appointment by calling me or sending me e-mail.

<P>
E-mail is almost always a good way to reach me;
I normally check it fairly often and reply promptly.

Grading</A>
</H3>

<P>
Grades in this course will be determined by the results of two
major exams (a midterm and a final),
several in-class quizzes, several homework assignments,
and class attendance/participation, weighted as follows.

<P>
Numeric grades will be calculated as a simple percentage, by dividing
total points earned on the above components by total points possible.
These numeric grades will then be converted to letter grades based
on a curve, but in no case will the resulting letter grades be worse
than students would receive based on the following scheme.

Exams</A>
</H3>

<P>
Exams are comprehensive but will emphasize the most recent material.
They are scheduled as follows; 
please plan accordingly (i.e., avoid scheduling anything else for
these times).

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Midterm:  October&nbsp;14, in class.
</LI>
<LI>Final exam:  December&nbsp;12, 8:30am.

<P>

<H3><A NAME="SECTION00004300000000000000">
Quizzes</A>
</H3>

<P>
About every other week there will be a short in-class
quiz.  Dates will be announced via the course Web page.
They will usually cover material from recent classes and reading;
the questions will be similar in format to those you are likely to
see on the major exams.
There will be about six quizzes over the course of the semester,
and the lowest grade will be dropped.

<P>

<H3><A NAME="SECTION00004400000000000000">
Homework assignments</A>
</H3>

<P>
Homework (in the form of programming assignments)
is a crucial part of this course;
much of what you learn will likely be learned in the course
of completing the programming assignments.
Detailed requirements will be provided as part of each assignment;
due dates will be announced via the course Web page.
You are strongly encouraged to use the department's network of Linux 
machines,
but unless otherwise specified for individual assignments, you may 
use any other system that provides a suitable environment.

<P>

<H3><A NAME="SECTION00004500000000000000">
Attendance</A>
</H3>

<P>
Regular class attendance is strongly encouraged;
class participation grades will be based largely on attendance.

<P>

<H3><A NAME="SECTION00004600000000000000">
E-mail</A>
</H3>

<P>
Course-related announcements will sometimes be made 
by sending e-mail to the Trinity e-mail addresses of
all registered students.
Students are strongly encouraged to read mail sent to
their Trinity addresses frequently.

<P>

<H3><A NAME="SECTION00004700000000000000">
Late and missed work</A>
</H3>

<P>
Exams can be made up only in cases of documented conflict with a 
university-sponsored activity, documented medical emergency,
or conflict with a religious holiday.
Quizzes cannot be made up, but the lowest quiz score will be
dropped, so you can miss one quiz without penalty.

<P>
Unless otherwise stated for a particular assignment,
homework will be accepted up to one class period late,
<I>but no more</I>,
at a penalty of 10 percent off per working day.  
This penalty may be waived or additional time allowed
<I>at the instructor's discretion</I>
in cases of illness or conflict with a university-sponsored activity
or religious holiday.

<P>
If you have unusual circumstances (as we all sometimes do), 
please discuss these with me as far in advance as possible.

<P>

<H3><A NAME="SECTION00004800000000000000">
Academic integrity at Trinity</A>
</H3>

<P>
All students are covered by a policy that prohibits dishonesty in
academic work.  Under the Honor Code, a faculty member will (or a student
may) report an alleged violation to the Academic Honor Council.  It is the
task of the Council to investigate, adjudicate, and assign a punishment
within certain guidelines if a violation has been verified.  Students who
are under the Honor Code are required to pledge all written work that is
submitted for a grade:  ``On my honor, I have neither given nor received any
unauthorized assistance on this work'' and their signature.  
The pledge may be abbreviated ``pledged'' with a signature.
For electronically submitted work, you should include the text -- either
the full version or just ``pledged'' -- somewhere in what you submit.

<P>

<H3><A NAME="SECTION00004900000000000000">
Collaboration and academic integrity in this course</A>
</H3>

<P>
Unless otherwise specified, all work submitted for a grade
(homework assignments, quizzes, and exams) must represent the student's
own individual effort.
Unless otherwise stated, all submitted work will be considered pledged work.

<P>
Discussion of homework assignments among students is allowed,
but not to the point where detailed answers 
are being written collectively.
If you are working with another student in a lab,
seeing another student's answers may be unavoidable,
but please do <I>not</I> share answers electronically.
If you are uncertain about whether a particular level of
collaboration is acceptable, please ask for clarification.
Graded papers and sample solutions from previous semesters
(homeworks) are off limits.  
Answers that are identical beyond coincidence (either to another
student's work or to a sample solution from a previous semester) will be
considered to be in violation of the Honor Code,
and <I>will result in appropriate action</I>.
You are responsible for the
security of your work, both electronic and hard copy.

<P>
Please also note when you turn in an assignment whether you sought
help with it from other students or faculty
(e.g., ``J.&nbsp;Random and I worked on this assignment together''
or ``I got help with this assignment from one of the ACM tutors'').
