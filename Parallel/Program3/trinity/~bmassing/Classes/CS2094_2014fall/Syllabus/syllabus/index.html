Course description</A>
</H2>

<P>
This course is a departmental seminar/colloquium.
As such, it is meant to serve several purposes:

<UL>
<LI>Exposing students to a variety of topics relevant to the field,
including current research, professional opportunities, and ethics.
</LI>
<LI>Providing a venue for research presentations, by both faculty
and students.
</LI>
<LI>Providing a venue for outside speakers to address the 
department as a whole.
</LI>
<LI>Fostering a sense of community among students and faculty.
</LI>
</UL>
The department believes that students benefit from attendance
and therefore includes the course in the list of requirements
for the majors and minor.

<P>
A current schedule of office hours can be found on my home Web page
(<TT><A NAME="tex2html2"
  HREF="http://www.cs.trinity.edu/~bmassing">http://www.cs.trinity.edu/~bmassing</A></TT>).
If I'm not in my office during office hours, 
I should be somewhere in CSI,
perhaps in one of the labs helping another student, 
and there will often be a note on my door saying where to find me.

<P>
In addition to scheduled office hours, you're welcome to
drop by and see if I'm in my office and free to talk, or you
can make an appointment by calling me or sending me e-mail.

<P>
E-mail is almost always a good way to reach me;
I normally check it fairly often and reply promptly.

Course requirements</A>
</H2>

<P>
Grades in this course will be based solely on attendance.
Everyone starts out with an&nbsp;A and can miss two classes without penalty.
After that, every class you miss reduces your letter grade
by one letter.
If you must miss more than two classes
because of conflicts with 
university-sponsored activities or religious holidays,
come talk to me and we will negotiate something appropriate.

<H3><A NAME="SECTION00004100000000000000">
Academic integrity at Trinity</A>
</H3>

<P>
All students are covered by a policy that prohibits dishonesty in
academic work.  Under the Honor Code, a faculty member will (or a student
may) report an alleged violation to the Academic Honor Council.  It is the
task of the Council to investigate, adjudicate, and assign a punishment
within certain guidelines if a violation has been verified.  Students who
are under the Honor Code are required to pledge all written work that is
submitted for a grade:  ``On my honor, I have neither given nor received any
unauthorized assistance on this work'' and their signature.  
The pledge may be abbreviated ``pledged'' with a signature.

<P>

<H3><A NAME="SECTION00004200000000000000">
Collaboration and academic integrity in this course</A>
</H3>

<P>
For the purposes of this course, ``pledged work'' is your attendance
at class meetings; by putting your name on a sign-in sheet or otherwise
registering your presence you are
pledging that you actually attended the class.
