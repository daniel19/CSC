Course description</A>
</H2>

<P>
In CSCI&nbsp;1320 (CS1) we introduce students to the basics of traditional
UNIX command-line tools.  These tools may seem clunky and primitive
compared to the GUI-based tools students are more apt to be familiar
with.  But behind the clunky-seeming interface there is a lot of
power and flexibility, in part because this traditional environment
includes a number of ``power tools'' that can be great timesavers
for the not-so-novice user.  In this course we will look at some
of these tools and also at the underlying UNIX philosophy/culture. 

<P>
The following are some topics we will discuss; others will be
included as time and students' interests permit.

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Command shells and shell scripts -- 
	timesaving interactive features, scripting,
	pipes and I/O redirection, and how I/O redirection
	meshes with standard I/O in programming languages.
</LI>
<LI>The <TT>make</TT> utility.
</LI>
<LI>Text-based utilities (<TT>grep</TT>, <TT>sed</TT>, etc.).
</LI>
<LI>Text editors.  (<TT>vi</TT> can do a lot more than you might think.)
</LI>
<LI>Text formatting with <TT>latex</TT> (the UNIX enthusiast's 
	alternative to word processing).

A current schedule of office hours can be found on my home Web page
(<TT><A NAME="tex2html2"
  HREF="http://www.cs.trinity.edu/~bmassing">http://www.cs.trinity.edu/~bmassing</A></TT>).
If I'm not in my office during office hours, 
I should be somewhere in CSI,
perhaps in one of the labs helping another student, 
and there will often be a note on my door saying where to find me.

<P>
In addition to scheduled office hours, you're welcome to
drop by and see if I'm in my office and free to talk, or you
can make an appointment by calling me or sending me e-mail.

<P>
E-mail is almost always a good way to reach me;
I normally check it fairly often and reply promptly.

<P>
There is no required textbook for this course.
The course Web page will have links to some useful on-line reading,
parts of which you will be expected to read/skim/consult.
If you want something hardcopy,
here are two books I have recommended in past years:

<I>Unix Power Tools</I>.
O'Reilly, 3rd edition, 2003.

<P>
I did not ask the bookstore to order copies, but they should be
available from your favorite purveyor of technical books.

Most course-related information 
(this syllabus, homework and reading assignments, etc.)
will be made available via the Web.  
The course Web page 
is a starting point for Web-accessible course material;
you can find it linked from my home page

Other references</A>
</H3>

<P>
Any bookstore with a sizable technical-reference section will
likely have many introductory books on UNIX or Linux,
such as the two mentioned as optional textbooks for the course.
The list of references below includes another such book
(<I>UNIX for the Impatient</I>),
plus an assortment of books about
UNIX philosophy/culture that make for interesting reading.
If you like the O'Reilly ``In a Nutshell'' books, 
you may want to acquire <I>UNIX in a Nutshell</I> or
<I>Linux in a Nutshell</I>.
O'Reilly also publishes many books on UNIX-related tools,
which are good to have on one's bookshelf as one's interests
and finances dictate.

Grading</A>
</H3>

<P>
Grades in this course will be determined on the basis of 
class attendance/participation and several homework assignments and a
project, weighted as follows.

<P>
<DIV ALIGN="CENTER">
<TABLE CELLPADDING=3 BORDER="1">
<TR><TH ALIGN="LEFT"><B>Component</B></TH>
<TH ALIGN="RIGHT"><B>Maximum points</B></TH>
</TR>

</TR>
<TR><TD ALIGN="LEFT">Class participation</TD>
<TD ALIGN="RIGHT">20</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
</DIV>

<P>
Numeric grades will be calculated as a simple percentage, by dividing
total points earned on the above components by total points possible.
These numeric grades will then be converted to letter grades based
on a curve, but in no case will the resulting letter grades be worse
than students would receive based on the following scheme.

<P>

<H3><A NAME="SECTION00004200000000000000">
Homework assignments</A>
</H3>

<P>
There will be frequent short homework assignments.
Detailed requirements will be provided as part of each assignment, and
due dates will be announced via the course Web page.

<P>

<H3><A NAME="SECTION00004300000000000000">
Project</A>
</H3>

<P>
As part of the course, students must also complete a 
project approved by the instructor and present it to the class.
Detailed requirements for the project will be described separately and will
include program code (or scripts, makefiles, etc.), 
a short written report, and a presentation to the class.

<P>
Notice that although there are no exams in this course, 
we will use the time scheduled for a final (December&nbsp;12 at 7pm)
for project presentations.
Please plan accordingly (i.e., avoid scheduling anything else for
that time).

<P>

<H3><A NAME="SECTION00004400000000000000">
Attendance</A>
</H3>

<P>
Regular class attendance is strongly encouraged;
class participation grades will be based largely on attendance.

<P>

<H3><A NAME="SECTION00004500000000000000">
E-mail</A>
</H3>

<P>
Course-related announcements will sometimes be made 
by sending e-mail to the Trinity e-mail addresses of
all registered students.
Students are strongly encouraged to read mail sent to
their Trinity addresses frequently.

<P>

<H3><A NAME="SECTION00004600000000000000">
Late and missed work</A>
</H3>

<P>
Unless otherwise stated for a particular assignment,
homework will be accepted up to one class period late,
<I>but no more</I>,
at a penalty of 10 percent off per working day.  
This penalty may be waived or additional time allowed
<I>at the instructor's discretion</I>
in cases of illness or conflict with a university-sponsored activity
or religious holiday.

<P>
If you have unusual circumstances (as we all sometimes do), 
please discuss these with me as far in advance as possible.

<P>

<H3><A NAME="SECTION00004700000000000000">
Academic integrity at Trinity</A>
</H3>

<P>
All students are covered by a policy that prohibits dishonesty in
academic work.  Under the Honor Code, a faculty member will (or a student
may) report an alleged violation to the Academic Honor Council.  It is the
task of the Council to investigate, adjudicate, and assign a punishment
within certain guidelines if a violation has been verified.  Students who
are under the Honor Code are required to pledge all written work that is
submitted for a grade:  ``On my honor, I have neither given nor received any
unauthorized assistance on this work'' and their signature.  
The pledge may be abbreviated ``pledged'' with a signature.
For electronically submitted work, you should include the text -- either
the full version or just ``pledged'' -- somewhere in what you submit.

<P>

<H3><A NAME="SECTION00004800000000000000">
Collaboration and academic integrity in this course</A>
</H3>

<P>
Unless otherwise specified, all work submitted for a grade
(homework assignments and projects) must represent the student's
own individual effort.
Unless otherwise stated all submitted work will be considered pledged work.

<P>
Discussion of homework assignments and course material
among students is allowed,
but not to the point where detailed answers 
are being written collectively.
If you are working with another student in a lab,
seeing another student's answers may be unavoidable,
but please do <I>not</I> share answers electronically.
If you are uncertain about whether a particular level of
collaboration is acceptable, please ask for clarification.
Graded papers and sample solutions from previous years
are off limits.
Answers that are identical beyond coincidence (either to another
student's work or to a sample solution from a previous year) will be
considered to be in violation of the Honor Code,
and <I>will result in appropriate action</I>.
You are responsible for the
security of your work, both electronic and hard copy.

<P>
Please also note when you turn in an assignment whether you sought
help with it from other students or faculty
(e.g., ``J.&nbsp;Random and I worked on this assignment together''
or ``I got help with this assignment from one of the ACM tutors'').
