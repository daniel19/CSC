<h2> News and information </h2>

<h4> Latest news (newest first) </h4>

<ul>

<li> (December 17)
	Everything is graded, and letter grades have been assigned.
	I've sent e-mail to each student with his or her exam score,
	final average, and letter grade.  Exams can be picked up
	next term.  Happy holidays!

<li> (December 14)
	I have graded everything except Exam 3.  For every student
	for whom I have an e-mail address, I've sent mail with a list
	of scores and an average (all but Exam 3).  (If you don't
	receive this message, I probably don't have your e-mail
	address.  Send me a message and I'll reply with your scores.)

<li> (December 13)
	Homework #9 is graded and can be picked up outside my 
	office (HAS201L).
