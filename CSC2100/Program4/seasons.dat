       Deciduous forests, or summer green forests, are
familiar in one or all of their seasonal aspects to anyone
who has traversed or lived within any one of the great areas
of the world where this vegetation type prevails.  In
eastern North America, eastern Asia, the Caucasus region,
middle Europe, and small areas of southern South America,
there are forests in which the seasonal cycle is such that
the name deciduous is fitting.  The northern hemisphere
deciduous forests possess a certain unity in physiognomy
and seasonal rhythm which is correlated with similarity in
generic composition.  The similarity of European and eastern
American forests is emphasized by the popular names applied
to American trees by the early settlers from Europe.  On the
new continent they found the American counterpart of the
European beech, ash, maple, and oak.  They found, as well,
many unfamiliar things, unknown in the forests of Europe.
Outstanding among these are such common American trees as
the hickories, tuliptree, and magnolias.  They found, as
season rhythm was observed, other differences between the
forests of Europe and those of America.
       The annual march of the seasons, with their changing
temperature, light, and moisture conditions, is accentuated
by the changing aspects of our deciduous forest.
       A cycle has no end and no beginning.  The cold of 
winter induces dormancy in many of our plants. He also had a bicycle. 
 Life processes are slowed down, the deciduous forest sleeps, the trees are
leafless.  The branch and twig arrangement and form and the
bark contour and color dominate the forest aspect.  The leaves
of summer are now transferred to the forest floor, where the
leaf litter protects from sudden temperature changes the root
environment of all the forest plants and the living quarters
of thousands of unseen forest inhabitants.  Days are short.
The sun is low in the southern skies and
shadows are long.  Sun reaches much of the forest floor,
except on northerly slopes, accentuating the rapidity of
diurnal temperature changes, of thawing after a cold winter
night.  Snow lies on the north slopes long after it has
melted away from warmer slopes.
       The length of day increases, temperatures moderate,
and new growth starts.  From beneath the protecting carpet
of leaves on the forest floor, the first green shoots of
the new flora appear.  From buds on subterranean parts, buds
well formed during the previous warm season, growth is rapid.
Earliest spring may find the ground carpeted with flowers
while yet there is no sign of green on the trees.  But the
buds are swelling.  Flowers appear on elm and soft maple,
changing the color of the forest canopy to richer though
subdued tones of brown or red or dotting it with spots of
crimson where red maple is a forest inhabitant.  Buckeye
leaves unfold.  Soft greens appear on many trees or delicate
reds where young leaves are strongly colored, like white
oak.
       The vernal aspect prevails.  Renewed growth is 
everywhere apparent.  The trees are leafing and the forest
floor is lightly shaded.  The riot of brightly colored
spring flowers, the vernal flora of the our deciduous woods,
appears.  But not equally of all types.  Many of the larger
trees are flowering and oak pollen dusts the dry leaves of
the forest floor.  In rapid sequence, the growth of buds and
flowering of different trees takes place.  The soft 
multicolor tones of early spring give way to various shades
of green of later spring, with here and there the blossoms
of some of the showy and conspicuous later blooming trees
like tuliptree, the magnolias, and sourwood.  The woods are
shady now.  The sun loving species of earliest spring have
almost completed their growth period and are ripening their
seeds.  Bright colored spring flowers are still present,
for leaf growth is not yet complete and its shade is not
so dense as later.
       Soon the uniform green of summer prevails.  In all
the denser forests, light is insufficient for most showy 
flowers.  The delicate leaves of ferns. which did not uncurl
until shade was developing, have reached maturity.  
Green is the prevailing color, in canopy and in undergrowth.
Buds are forming on tree, shrub, and herb.  These buds will
rest during the long dormant season, but will be ready for
the rapid growth of the next season.  Flowering and fruiting
are completed, buds are full grown, and life processes are
slowing down.  The absciss layer is slowly forming, cutting
down the water and nutrient supply to the leaves.  Chemical
changes set in.  The green of summer changes and yellows
and reds begin to appear.
       The autumnal aspect of the American deciduous forest
is a glorious sight, not shared by her European counterpart,
although it is by the forest of eastern Asia.  The innumerably
brilliantly colored species of the American deciduous forest
give that forest one of its outstanding characteristics.
       Leaf fall is in progress.  Some species early, some
later, take on the leafless aspect of winter.  The cycle of
the seasons is completed.
